Develop a machine learning model that can accurately distinguish between rocks and mines based on various features derived from sensor data or imagery.

Dataset
Description: The dataset should contain labeled instances of rocks and mines. Each instance might include features such as spectral data, texture, shape, and possibly geographical information.
Sources: You can use publicly available datasets such as the Mines vs Rocks dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or create a custom dataset using imagery and sensor data.
Steps
Data Collection and Preprocessing

Collect data from reliable sources or sensors.
Preprocess the data to clean and normalize it. This might include handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical features if any.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform EDA to understand the distribution of the data, relationships between features, and identify any patterns or anomalies.
Visualize the data using plots and graphs.
Feature Engineering

Extract relevant features from the raw data. For instance, if using imagery, features could include color histograms, texture patterns, and edge detection metrics.
Select the most informative features using techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or feature importance scores from models.
Model Selection and Training

Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the models on the training set and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Evaluation and Comparison

Compare the performance of different models to select the best one.
Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and avoid overfitting.
